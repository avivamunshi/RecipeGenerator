If you don\u2019t have a small mortar, you can put the saffron and sugar on a piece of parchment paper, fold all the sides so the powder won\u2019t escape, then grind with a jam jar or rolling pin until you have a very fine powder.\nBring a kettle of water to a boil, then let it sit for a few minutes. Tip the powder very gently into a small glass teacup, then gently pour 3 tablespoons of the hot water over it. (Never use boiling water, or you\u2019ll \u201ckill\u201d the saffron.) Cover the cup with a lid or saucer and let the mixture \u201cbrew\u201d for at least 10 minutes without removing the lid, to release the color and aroma of the saffron.

While the pan is heating, mix the saffron infusion, hot water, salt, and lemon juice in a bowl until the salt has dissolved.\nWhen you can feel the heat of the pan with your palm held 4 inches above it, reduce the heat to medium and toast the pistachios, constantly turning and flipping them so they don\u2019t burn. After about 15 minutes, or when they smell toasty and nutty and they have darkened slightly, quickly add them to the saffron mixture and mix well, making sure all the pistachios are equally absorbing the liquid. Leave to soak for 10\u201315 minutes.\nWipe out the pan, so that any small crumbs don\u2019t burn, and keep it warm over low heat.\nOnce the pistachios have rested, turn the heat back up to medium and return the soaked pistachios to the hot pan, with all the juices left in the bottom of the bowl.

Remove the garlic when charred and softened and when it is cool enough to handle, peel it. Alternatively, you can toast the vegetables on a hot comal or skillet over medium heat, turning them every 4 to 5 minutes, until charred and soft.\nTransfer the tomatoes, onion, and garlic to a blender, along with any juices on the baking sheet.\nSet a comal or small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the chipotles and peanuts and toast, stirring the peanuts and turning the chiles from time to time, just until the chiles soften, puff, and begin to lightly toast but not burn, 4 to 5 minutes. The peanuts should be slightly toasted, but that will barely show. Transfer to the blender.\nToast the oregano on the hot pan for 10 to 15 seconds, until fragrant and just beginning to darken, and add to the blender.\nAdd the vinegar, water, and salt to the blender and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the salt. Do ahead: Salsa will keep, tightly covered, for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Stir well before using.\nWhisk together all the ingredients in a small bowl. If the sauce isn\u2019t smooth and thin enough to be drizzled over the tacos, add a bit more water to thin it out, or more lime juice if you\u2019d like it a bit more sour. Do ahead: Tahini sauce can be kept, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nTo make the marinade: Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and toast, shaking the pan or stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds. Add the oregano and thyme and cook, stirring, for another 10 to 15 seconds, until fragrant. Transfer to a blender. Add the lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper to the blender and puree until smooth. Add the parsley and mint and pulse a few times, just until the herbs are coarsely pureed. You want a textured marinade.\nTo marinate the pork: Place a layer of the meat in a large bowl. Cover with some of the marinade and then a layer of onions. Cover with more of the marinade. Continue with the layers, making sure that both the meat and the onions are covered with marinade. Cover, refrigerate, and marinate for at least 4 hours, and up to 24 hours.\nTo make the tacos: Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Or heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Brush the cooking surface with oil.

Wash down any crystals from the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Turn the heat down to medium and cook, without stirring, until the syrup becomes a medium-dark amber caramel, about 15 minutes; you can carefully swirl the pan around to check the color.\nCarefully remove the pan from the heat and immediately stir in the butter and heavy cream.
