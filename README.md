### Project type: 
Tool: Web Application (Streamlit) 


### Questions of interest: 
How can the recipe be generated in a random manner? 
How do we make sure that only one recipe is the output with many recipes being possible?
What additional filters can we have apart from the recipe ingredients? (Can we add label types or filters?) For eg - cuisine type, calories limit, time duration
### Input/Output:
Input: List of ingredients 
Output: one random recipe produced based on input. 


### Goal for the project output: 
The goal is to build a Streamlit web application that can generate a single recipe using the ingredients provided by the user. The output should be a randomly generated recipe that utilizes only the ingredients listed.
