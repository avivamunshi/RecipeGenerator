### Project type: 
Tool: Web Application (Streamlit) 


### Questions of interest: 
1. How can the recipe be generated in a random manner?<br> 
2. How do we make sure that only one recipe is the output with many recipes being possible?<br>
3. What additional filters can we have apart from the recipe ingredients? (Can we add label types or filters?) For eg - cuisine type, calories limit, time duration


### Input/Output:
Input: List of ingredients<br>
Output: one random recipe produced based on input. 


### Goal for the project output: 
The goal is to build a Streamlit web application that can generate a single recipe using the ingredients provided by the user. The output should be a randomly generated recipe that utilizes only the ingredients listed.
