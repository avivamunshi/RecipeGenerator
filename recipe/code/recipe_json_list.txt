Butter a 9x4\" loaf pan, fully coating bottom and sides. Line pan lengthwise with parchment paper, leaving about a 2\" overhang. Are you reading this and wondering, \"Can I use wax paper instead of parchment paper?\" The answer is: absolutely NOT. That strip of parchment paper will help you to lift the finished cake out of the loaf pan cleanly. Wax paper, on the other hand, will melt and stick to the cake\u2014it's never meant to go into the oven. Now you know!\nUsing a Microplane, finely grate the zest from 2 lemons into a large bowl. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted room temperature butter and 1 cup granulated sugar to bowl. It might be tempting to ignore the part about the butter being \"room temperature,\" but working with butter that's soft and spreadable\u2014but not melted\u2014is essential here.\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat until mixture is very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. You know how people talk about \"creaming\" butter and sugar together? That's what you're doing here. You're basically whipping a bunch of air into the butter and sugar mixture, which will help keep the finished cake light and fluffy. And as we mentioned in the last step, that butter needs to be room temp in order for this to work.\nBeat in 3 eggs one at a time, waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next. Continue to beat until mixture is lighter and even fluffier, about 2 minutes.\nWhisk 1\u00be cups all-purpose flour, 1\u00bd tsp. baking powder, and \u00bd tsp. salt in another large bowl. It might seem funny to add salt to a dessert recipe, but a little bit helps to make all of the rich, sweet elements really sing.\nAdd one-half of dry ingredients to butter mixture and beat on low speed just until combined.\nBeat in 6 Tbsp. milk on low just until smooth, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat just until combined. Now that you've added the flour, you want to mix the batter as little as possible\u2014if you beat it up too much, you'll start to form gluten, which will make the cake tough. Using a spatula, scrape down sides of bowl and give batter a final mix so dry ingredients are fully incorporated.\nScrape batter into your buttered loaf pan; smooth top with a spatula. Bake cake, turning once halfway through, until a cake tester, toothpick, skewer, or thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 45-55 minutes.\nWhile the cake bakes, make the glaze: First, remove zest from remaining lemon with a vegetable peeler in wide strips.

Put the tomatoes, garlic cloves, and onion on a baking sheet lined with foil and broil, turning the vegetables halfway through, until they are charred and the tomatoes are mushy, 5 to 7 minutes for the garlic, and 10 to 12 minutes for the other vegetables. Remove the garlic when charred and softened and when it is cool enough to handle, peel it. Alternatively, you can toast the vegetables on a hot comal or skillet over medium heat, turning them every 4 to 5 minutes, until charred and soft.\nTransfer the tomatoes, onion, and garlic to a blender, along with any juices on the baking sheet.\nSet a comal or small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the chipotles and peanuts and toast, stirring the peanuts and turning the chiles from time to time, just until the chiles soften, puff, and begin to lightly toast but not burn, 4 to 5 minutes. The peanuts should be slightly toasted, but that will barely show. Transfer to the blender.\nToast the oregano on the hot pan for 10 to 15 seconds, until fragrant and just beginning to darken, and add to the blender.\nAdd the vinegar, water, and salt to the blender and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the salt. Do ahead: Salsa will keep, tightly covered, for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Stir well before using.\nWhisk together all the ingredients in a small bowl. If the sauce isn\u2019t smooth and thin enough to be drizzled over the tacos, add a bit more water to thin it out, or more lime juice if you\u2019d like it a bit more sour. Do ahead: Tahini sauce can be kept, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nTo make the marinade: Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and toast, shaking the pan or stirring, for 20 to 30 seconds. Add the oregano and thyme and cook, stirring, for another 10 to 15 seconds, until fragrant. Transfer to a blender. Add the lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper to the blender and puree until smooth. Add the parsley and mint and pulse a few times, just until the herbs are coarsely pureed. You want a textured marinade.\nTo marinate the pork: Place a layer of the meat in a large bowl. Cover with some of the marinade and then a layer of onions. Cover with more of the marinade. Continue with the layers, making sure that both the meat and the onions are covered with marinade. Cover, refrigerate, and marinate for at least 4 hours, and up to 24 hours.\nTo make the tacos: Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Or heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Brush the cooking surface with oil. Cook the meat in batches (leave the onions in the bowl, or most of them\u2014it\u2019s fine if some of the onions stick to the meat), taking care not to overcrowd the grill or pan, turning the meat once, for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until it is cooked through and has a nice char all over the surface. As you cook, transfer the cooked meat to a lidded container, or transfer to a platter and cover tightly with foil.\nIf using a grill, use a vegetable grill pan to cook the onions. Grill the onions, turning with tongs, until tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Or cook the onions in the skillet. Scrape the cooked onions over the meat.\nSlice the meat into approximately 1\" by 1\u20444\" strips. As you cut it, return it to the covered container so it stays warm.\nHeat a comal or large skillet over medium-low heat. Working in batches, heat the pita bread or tortillas, turning once, until warmed through and lightly browned on both sides.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together both flours, the fine sea salt, baking powder, sugar, and baking soda. Add the cold butter cubes and toss to coat. Working quickly, cut in the butter with a pastry blender, or pinch the cubes with your fingertips, smearing them into the flour. You should have various-sized pieces of butter ranging from coarse sandy patches to flat shaggy shards to pea-sized chunks. Give the ingredients a good toss with your hands to make sure all the pieces of butter are completely coated in flour.\nMake a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour in the buttermilk, and use your hands to mix the dry ingredients into the buttermilk until you have a shaggy dough. Gently turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. The dough should still look crumbly. Now be prepared to get messy! Using the heel of your hand, smear the butter into the flour\u2014that is how you build those flaky layers.

Begin by doing a tri-fold, starting from the right: Fold the right side of the dough over the center and then fold the left side over the first fold, lining up the edges and pressing the layers together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a rectangle, then fold the dough in half from the top down, pressing the layers together. Roll the dough out again into a rectangle and fold it in half once more, pressing the layers down again. Then, using a bench scraper or a sharp knife, cut the dough in half and stack the bottom half on the top half, pressing the layers together. Dust the dough lightly with flour, and roll the dough out again into a rectangle about 1 inch thick.\nDip the edges of a 2\u00bc-inch biscuit cutter in flour and punch out the biscuits; do not twist the cutter, or you will seal the layers of the dough you have worked so hard to create, and the biscuits will not rise as high. Make sure to dip the cutter in flour after every cut, and arrange the biscuits 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Then carefully gather up your scraps, press them together until you have a cohesive mass, roll them out again, and cut more biscuits. The scrap biscuits may bake a little topsy-turvy, but that\u2019s okay; they will still be flaky and delicious.

On a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, roll out the chilled dough into a 12-inch round. Roll the dough from the center out, rotating it slightly as you roll to prevent sticking and to keep it round. Dust off any excess flour using a dry pastry brush. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and place it in the pie dish. Carefully arrange the dough to slump inside the dish and press it into the edges. Trim the excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving about a 1-inch overhang.

Wrap in plastic wrap and return the dough to the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.\nWhen ready to make the pie, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.\nTo make the caramel: Combine the granulated sugar, fleur de sel, and \u00bd cup water in a medium saucepan and cook over medium-high, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. Wash down any crystals from the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Turn the heat down to medium and cook, without stirring, until the syrup becomes a medium-dark amber caramel, about 15 minutes; you can carefully swirl the pan around to check the color.\nCarefully remove the pan from the heat and immediately stir in the butter and heavy cream. Be careful of hot steam when the heavy cream is added, and do not worry if the butter starts to separate\u2014it will come together once the caramel is cooled.\nTransfer the caramel to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or to a medium mixing bowl, if using a handheld mixer) and beat on low speed until the caramel cools and starts to come together. Set aside.\nTo make the filling: Put the lemon zest and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add the apples and toss gently.\nIn a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and turbinado sugar. Gently toss the apples with this mixture.\nTo assemble the pie: Place the bottom pie crust in a 9-inch pie pan and prick the bottom of the crust gently all over with a fork. Layer the apple mixture in the crust, making sure there are no gaps between the apples. Pour \u00bc cup of the caramel mixture on top of the apples. Reserve the remaining caramel for serving.\nPlace the top pie crust on a work surface and cut 4 to 8 vent holes in the center with a mini cookie cutter in whatever shape you like. Reserve the cutout pieces for decorating the crust. Brush the rim of the bottom pie crust with the egg wash to create a seal. Place the top crust over the pie filling and seal and crimp the edges, trimming the excess dough. Decorate with the cutout pieces, and brush the entire crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle lightly with turbinado sugar and pinch of fleur de sel.\nPlace pie on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Turn the oven down to 375\u00b0F and bake for an additional 45 to 60 minutes, until the caramel blossoms into big, thick, syrupy bubbles and the crust turns golden brown; test the apples with a small paring knife to make sure they are tender but not mushy. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 4 hours before serving to allow the juices and caramel to thicken.
