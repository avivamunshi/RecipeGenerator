Continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic and slaps against sides of bowl, 10\u201315 minutes.

If it feels crumbly and dry, work in more butter 1 Tbsp. at a time. Gather topping into a ball, wrap in plastic, and set aside.\nTurn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 15 equal pieces (about 65 g each); cover with a kitchen towel. Working with 1 piece at a time, cup your hand over dough and drag across surface in a rapid circular motion to form dough into a tight ball. Do not add flour, as you want friction between the dough and the surface.\nDivide balls between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3\" apart. Press each ball with your palm to flatten by about half (dough will start to slowly rise again once your hand is lifted).\nDivide topping into 15 equal pieces (20\u201327 g each, depending on what mix-in you used). Working with 1 piece at a time, roll pieces into balls. Using a tortilla press lined with plastic wrap, gently flatten balls to about \u00bc\" thick (if you don\u2019t have a press, you can place a piece on a large sheet of plastic, fold plastic over to cover, and press with a pie dish or small skillet to flatten). Whisk 1 large egg yolk and \u00bd tsp. water in a small bowl to blend. Brush each ball of dough with egg wash. Firmly press topping over surface of each conchas so it completely adheres to top of dough.\nUsing a concha cutter or a sharp paring knife, score topping to make curved lines that resemble the surface of a seashell about \u00bc\" apart; be careful not to cut into dough. Cover conchas with kitchen towels and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in volume and dough springs back slowly when poked with your finger, 1\u00bd\u20132 hours. (Timing will depend on the temperature. It\u2019s okay if score marks expand and the topping is cracked in places.)\nWhen conchas are almost done rising, place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0.\nUncover conchas and bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until topping is firm to the touch and cracked, and buns are golden brown on the bottom and between cracks in topping, 22\u201325 minutes.

Gather topping into a ball, wrap in plastic, and set aside.\nTurn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 15 equal pieces (about 65 g each); cover with a kitchen towel. Working with 1 piece at a time, cup your hand over dough and drag across surface in a rapid circular motion to form dough into a tight ball. Do not add flour, as you want friction between the dough and the surface.\nDivide balls between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3\" apart. Press each ball with your palm to flatten by about half (dough will start to slowly rise again once your hand is lifted).\nDivide topping into 15 equal pieces (20\u201327 g each, depending on what mix-in you used). Working with 1 piece at a time, roll pieces into balls. Using a tortilla press lined with plastic wrap, gently flatten balls to about \u00bc\" thick (if you don\u2019t have a press, you can place a piece on a large sheet of plastic, fold plastic over to cover, and press with a pie dish or small skillet to flatten). Whisk 1 large egg yolk and \u00bd tsp. water in a small bowl to blend. Brush each ball of dough with egg wash. Firmly press topping over surface of each conchas so it completely adheres to top of dough.\nUsing a concha cutter or a sharp paring knife, score topping to make curved lines that resemble the surface of a seashell about \u00bc\" apart; be careful not to cut into dough. Cover conchas with kitchen towels and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in volume and dough springs back slowly when poked with your finger, 1\u00bd\u20132 hours. (Timing will depend on the temperature. It\u2019s okay if score marks expand and the topping is cracked in places.)\nWhen conchas are almost done rising, place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0.\nUncover conchas and bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until topping is firm to the touch and cracked, and buns are golden brown on the bottom and between cracks in topping, 22\u201325 minutes.
